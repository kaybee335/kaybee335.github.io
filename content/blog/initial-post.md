Summary: An introduction to the intended purpose in creating this blog. Or why am I creating another (likely to be abandoned eventually) blog.

As the initial post I figured I would try and summarise the *intend*ed purpose here. So here we go and we'll see how things pan out...

I build a lot of projects using various ESP platforms for home network connected devices. I have used Home Assistant for over a decade and about two years ago discovered ESPHome. Bam! Heaven. Code amazingly complex devices using YAML and they just show up in my home automation all ready to use. Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, not really, but sorta.

There a **lot** of amazing features in ESPHome but some of them are quite complex to use and/or difficult to figure out.  As I've learned, I have tended to 'document' what I have learned on Twitter.  Guess what? I can't find any of my own good tips, ideas, etc. when I want to refer to them again.

So that's **Goal #1**.  Gather the more useful things I have tweeted about/learned and collect them here so **I** can find them again.  In the process, I made the executive decision inflicting them on the general public wouldn't hurt that much. Nope, it wasn't an excuse to play with Pelican for generating the blog, not at all. Trust me. 

After a couple of years of projects I have a **lot** of 'cut and paste' code in my ESPHome YAML. This has been bothering me for a while as it seems when I learn something new (pretty much every project) I have to 'backport' to my older projects or leave them without the benefit of the new feature/knowledge.

So that's **Goal #2**: I have some ideas about how I want re-organise things to do this but it's going to be a multi step process. It's also going to require a little more extensive documentation (for my own protection) than a Twitter thread. This will be the home for that as well.

Two goals is enough for something that I am not entirely certain I will keep up. There will likely also be random posts about things that are *possibly* related to an ongoing project in some way or form. There are a lot of dead blogs out there and this just may join them. Doesn't mean it may not have some useful info before then though.

Blog Name Explanation: SentientHouse is what my daughter began to call things when home automation implemention here really started to expand with ESPs.  Generally in a statement of the form "Is SentientHouse having a brain fart again?".
